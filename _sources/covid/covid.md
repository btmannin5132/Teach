# COVID-19 Work

### Over the course of the COVID-19 Pandemic, Amanda and I worked to provide supplies to medical facilities, local public Service departments, and the general public.  Below is a running tally of everything that we have made during the bulk of the pandemic.



### THANK YOU!
To everyone that has donated to help us be successful in this project, we cannot thank you enough for your generosity.  Over the course of this project, we have been able to produce over 3000 products that have gone right back into our community and the nation, helping protect those around us. We have received donations from at least 5 states, and have distributed supplies to 14 states around the United States. 

The additional rolls of filament that have not been used have gone to good use, as they will be used to educate STEAM students in Georgia.  There have also been requests from local schools for us to produce more (1500+) shields and masks for teachers, students and the countless support staff that make our schools functional.  As of Fall 2024, the final roll of fillament got used making some chassis for our combat robotics club here at Purdue!
